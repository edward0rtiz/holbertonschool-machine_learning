# 0x10 Natural Language Processing :robot:

> Natural Language Processing or NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence that gives the machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages. In this project there will some experiments with the metrics evaluation such as the BLEU scorre, ROUGE and perplexity 

At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What are the applications of natural language processing?
* What is a BLEU score?
* What is a ROUGE score?
* What is perplexity?
* When should you use one evaluation metric over another?

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:


-  Function def uni_bleu(references, sentence): that calculates the unigram BLEU score for a sentence
-  Function def ngram_bleu(references, sentence, n): that calculates the n-gram BLEU score for a sentence
-  Function def cumulative_bleu(references, sentence, n): that calculates the cumulative n-gram BLEU score for a sentence
