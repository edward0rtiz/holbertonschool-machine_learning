# 0x03 Probability :robot:

> Probability is the Bedrock of Machine Learning. Classification models must predict a probability of class membership. Algorithms are designed using probability (e.g. Naive Bayes). ... Algorithms are trained under probability frameworks (e.g. maximum likelihood).


At the end of this project I was able to solve these conceptual questions:

* What is probability?
* Basic probability notation
* What is independence? What is disjoint?
* What is a union? intersection?
* What are the general addition and multiplication rules?
* What is a probability distribution?
* What is a probability distribution function? probability mass function?
* What is a cumulative distribution function?
* What is a percentile?
* What is mean, standard deviation, and variance?
* Common probability distributions
